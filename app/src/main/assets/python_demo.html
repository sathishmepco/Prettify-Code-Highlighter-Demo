#Factorial of n is the product of all positive
#descending integers.
#Factorial of n is denoted by n!.
#For example:
#4! = 4*3*2*1 = 24
#5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120

    # change the value for a different result
    num = 7

    # uncomment to take input from the user
    #num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

    factorial = 1

    # check if the number is negative, positive or zero
    if num < 0:
       print("Factorial does not exist for negative numbers")
    elif num == 0:
       print("The factorial of 0 is 1")
    else:
       for i in range(1,num + 1):
           factorial = factorial*i
       print("The factorial of ",num," is: ",factorial)

    #OUTPUT

    #Factorial of 5 is: 120
    #Factorial of 6 is: 720
    #Factorial of 4 is: 24
    #Factorial of 12 is: 479001600
